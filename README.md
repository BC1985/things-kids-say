### General Info
I got the idea of building this app during a year in which I was working with a group of 4 year olds who always kept me laughing. I compiled the funniest things they said during that time and posted them to a database which I created using MongoDB and using React as a client. In addition to browsing, other users can register, log in, post and edit quotes in the [backend](https://github.com/BC1985/things_kids_say_api).
