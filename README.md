### General Info
I had the idea of building this app during a year in which I worked with a group of 4 year olds when I was constantly being struck by their innocent wisdom and antics. I compiled the funniest things they said during that time and posted them to a database which I created using MongoDB and using React as a client.

* React utilizing React hooks
* CSS3
