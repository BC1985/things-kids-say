### General Info
I had the idea of building this app during a year in which I worked with a group of 4 year olds when I was constantly being struck by their innocent wisdom and antics. I compiled the funniest things they said during that time and posted them to a database I created using MongoDB on the backend and designed a React client with Bootstrap for other parents or educators to post their favorite quotes by young children.
